Adds clipboard memory limit for transfers between server/clients, the feature was documented
in wiki but missing in code. The feature can be set by using the spin box under the clipboard
checkbox in advanced settings.

The value used to limit clipboard size to transfer between client and sever is set in bytes
and can be set in the UI or throough the config file by setting the value in bytes with the
'clipboardSharingSize' tag.
